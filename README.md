Catalyst.jl is a symbolic modeling package for analysis and high performance
simulation of chemical reaction networks. Catalyst defines symbolic
[`ReactionSystem`](https://docs.sciml.ai/Catalyst/stable/catalyst_functionality/programmatic_CRN_construction/)s,
which can be created programmatically or easily
specified using Catalyst's domain specific language (DSL). Leveraging
[ModelingToolkit](https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl) and
[Symbolics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Symbolics.jl), Catalyst enables
large-scale simulations through auto-vectorization and parallelism. Symbolic
`ReactionSystem`s can be used to generate ModelingToolkit-based models, allowing
the easy simulation and parameter estimation of mass action ODE models, Chemical
Langevin SDE models, stochastic chemical kinetics jump process models, and more.
Generated models can be used with solvers throughout the broader
[SciML](https://sciml.ai) ecosystem, including higher level SciML packages (e.g.
for sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation, machine learning applications,
etc).

## Breaking changes and new features

**NOTE:** version 13 is a breaking release, with changes to simplify the DSL
notation while also adding more features, changes to how chemical species are
specified symbolically when directly building `ReactionSystem`s, and changes that
simplify how to include ODE or algebraic constraint equation.

Breaking changes and new functionality are summarized in the
[HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md) file.

## Tutorials and documentation

For tutorials and information on using the package, [see the stable
documentation](https://docs.sciml.ai/Catalyst/stable/). The [in-development
documentation](https://docs.sciml.ai/Catalyst/dev/) describes unreleased features in
the current master branch.

Several Youtube video tutorials and overviews are also available:
- From JuliaCon 2022: A three hour tutorial workshop overviewing how to use
  Catalyst and its more advanced features as of version 12.1. [Workshop
  video](https://youtu.be/tVfxT09AtWQ), [Workshop Pluto.jl
  Notebooks](https://github.com/SciML/JuliaCon2022_Catalyst_Workshop).
- From SIAM CSE 2021: A short 15 minute overview of Catalyst as of version 6 is
available in the talk [Modeling Biochemical Systems with
Catalyst.jl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p1PJE5A5Jw).
- From JuliaCon 2018: A short 13 minute overview of Catalyst when it was known
  as DiffEqBiological in older versions is available in the talk [Efficient
  Modelling of Biochemical Reaction
  Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1e72k5XD6s)

## Features

- A DSL provides a simple and readable format for manually specifying chemical
  reactions.
- Catalyst `ReactionSystem`s provide a symbolic representation of reaction networks,
  built on [ModelingToolkit.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/ModelingToolkit/stable/) and
  [Symbolics.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/Symbolics/stable/).
- Non-integer (e.g. `Float64`) stoichiometric coefficients are supported for generating
  ODE models, and symbolic expressions for stoichiometric coefficients are supported for
  all system types.
- The [Catalyst.jl API](http://docs.sciml.ai/Catalyst/stable/api/catalyst_api) provides functionality for extending networks,
  building networks programmatically, network analysis, and for composing multiple
  networks together.
- `ReactionSystem`s generated by the DSL can be converted to a variety of
  `ModelingToolkit.AbstractSystem`s, including symbolic ODE, SDE and jump process
  representations.
- Coupled differential and algebraic constraint equations can be included in
  Catalyst models, and are incorporated during conversion to ODEs or steady
  state equations.
- Conservation laws can be detected and applied to reduce system sizes, and generate
  non-singular Jacobians, during conversion to ODEs, SDEs, and steady state equations.
- By leveraging ModelingToolkit, users have a variety of options for generating
  optimized system representations to use in solvers. These include construction
  of dense or sparse Jacobians, multithreading or parallelization of generated
  derivative functions, automatic classification of reactions into optimized
  jump types for Gillespie type simulations, automatic construction of
  dependency graphs for jump systems, and more.
- Generated systems can be solved using any
  [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/)
  ODE/SDE/jump solver, and can be used within `EnsembleProblem`s for carrying
  out parallelized parameter sweeps and statistical sampling. Plot recipes
  are available for visualizing the solutions.
- [Symbolics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Symbolics.jl)) symbolic
  expressions and Julia `Expr`s can be obtained for all rate laws and functions
  determining the deterministic and stochastic terms within resulting ODE, SDE
  or jump models.
- [Latexify](https://korsbo.github.io/Latexify.jl/stable/) can be used to generate
  LaTeX expressions corresponding to generated mathematical models or the
  underlying set of reactions.
- [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) can be used to generate and visualize
  reaction network graphs. (Reusing the Graphviz interface created in
  [Catlab.jl](https://algebraicjulia.github.io/Catlab.jl/stable/).)

## Packages supporting Catalyst
- Catalyst [`ReactionSystem`](@ref)s can be imported from SBML files via
  [SBMLToolkit.jl](https://github.com/SciML/SBMLToolkit.jl), and from BioNetGen .net
  files and various stoichiometric matrix network representations using
  [ReactionNetworkImporters.jl](https://github.com/SciML/ReactionNetworkImporters.jl).
- [MomentClosure.jl](https://github.com/augustinas1/MomentClosure.jl) allows
  generation of symbolic ModelingToolkit `ODESystem`s, representing moment
  closure approximations to moments of the Chemical Master Equation, from
  reaction networks defined in Catalyst.
- [FiniteStateProjection.jl](https://github.com/kaandocal/FiniteStateProjection.jl)
  allows the construction and numerical solution of Chemical Master Equation
  models from reaction networks defined in Catalyst.
- [DelaySSAToolkit.jl](https://github.com/palmtree2013/DelaySSAToolkit.jl) can
  augment Catalyst reaction network models with delays, and can simulate the
  resulting stochastic chemical kinetics with delays models.


## Illustrative examples
#### Gillespie simulations of Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics

```julia
using Catalyst, Plots, JumpProcesses
rs = @reaction_network begin
  c1, S + E --> SE
  c2, SE --> S + E

tspan = (0., 100.)
u0 = [:S => 301, :E => 100, :SE => 0, :P => 0]
